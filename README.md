# Agriculture Site Mockup

This project was developed as part of the "Tehnici web" course and serves as a mockup for an agriculture-focused website. Our aim was to create an interactive and user-friendly platform that brings together farmers and agricultural enthusiasts. The site showcases various agricultural products, provides informative content, and facilitates the exchange of knowledge within the agricultural community.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web content and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the website to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: To add interactivity to the web pages, enhancing user experience.
- **APIs**: Utilized to fetch real-time data related to agriculture, such as weather conditions, market prices, and agricultural news.

## Features

- Responsive design ensuring the site is accessible on various devices.
- Dynamic content presentation through the use of APIs.
- Interactive user interface allowing users to engage with the content effectively.

## Note on Deployment

Please be aware that depending on the environment in which the site is deployed or tested, it might be necessary to **update the paths** to certain resources or API endpoints. Ensure that all paths are correctly configured to avoid issues with resource loading and API calls.
